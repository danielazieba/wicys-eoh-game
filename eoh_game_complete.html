  <h1>CONGRATULATIONS!</h1>
  <p>You've completed all the cybersecurity puzzles that need to be solved in order to make breakfast.</p>
  <br>
  <p>We took inspiration from Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions in designing the puzzles you just solved and tried to make them a bit beginner-friendly. CTF competitions are a great way to learn more about cybersecurity, though they definitely aren't the only way.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Or, if you're not into CTFs, some things you can do are generally learn more about operating systems (especially Linux), improve your programming skills, read CTF challenge write-ups, or watch talks from DEF CON (an annual security conference) to get inspired about interesting security topics.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Some additional links:</p>
  <p>- <a href="https://overthewire.org/wargames/">https://overthewire.org/wargames/</a> is a great way to gain confidence navigating the Linux command-line and learning some common code exploits.</p>
  <p>- <a href="https://picoctf.org/">https://picoctf.org/</a> is a fantastic starting point if you want to dive a bit deeper than our game goes.</p>
  <p>- <a href="https://ctftime.org/">https://ctftime.org/</a> lists upcoming CTFs if youâ€™re looking for more past picoCTF.</p>
