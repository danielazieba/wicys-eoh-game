# WiCyS 2021 - EOH game

## Contributing

We plan to use Unity, though right now are just chilling and making some basic pixel art for some initial maps. Style isn't important yet, but make a separate branch for development and make a pull request if you would like your work to be in master.

That being said regarding style, please do not commit unnecessary files such as .pyc or DS_Store files.

Your pixel art should be made in tiles of size 16x16, and fit the aesthetic of Bee and Puppycat. White, pink, purple, and blue allowed, other colors less so.

## Running the code

You need python3, after which you should install numpy and OpenCV (```pip install opencv-python``` should do the trick). Then, once you want to generate a map, run ```python concat_pixel_art.py``` and swap out any image name or character in the map with what you desire.

## To do

- Make a few small maps
- Start Unity game
- Make a basic main character sprite
- Once initial assets are formed and basic Unity game is made where players can walk around on the map, start more serious planning about game mechanics

## Colors
- Purple: #bd9aff
