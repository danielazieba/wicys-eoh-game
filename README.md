# WiCyS: EOH 2021 JavaScript edition

## Things you need

- Node.js
- HTTP server (https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)
- The code in this repo

## How to run

Get into the top-level directory and start up your http-server. You should just need to type ```http-server``` and have things work. Then, open up ```localhost:8080``` and click files until you get to opening ```eoh-game.html```.

## How to work on this

This is built on ga.js, a basic game engine. If you have questions about built-in functions for that, see https://github.com/kittykatattack/ga.
